#### The .js file is the bookmarklet. You will add it to your bookmarks after you transform it...

#### The .scpt file is the Script Editor script you'll need.
* Step 1) Copy it [raw (click here)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theredwillow/rbJXA/master/StarLordHelper.scpt) from github.
* Step 2) Open the Script Editor in Mac and make sure it's set to JavaScript in the top left hand side.

#### Spreadsheet requirements
* Keep the spreadsheet in the same window as Star Lord
* Title your spreadsheet "Sheet for Star Lord"
* Freeze the first row (the headers)

#### Starlord requirements
* Until I fix it, have these columns selected in display before you first run the script
"Status    Address    Apt #    Owner    #Bdrm    Rent    Sq. Footage    #Bthrms    Phone    Owner Pays    Date Available    Last Updated    Modified By    Origin Source    Star Lord    Listing Summary"
* Until I fix it, keep only one chrome window open at a time
